# port4l

## ✨ Indroduction
port4l is a basic port scanner console application written in Python3. Also it uses Scapy for many things and tqdm to display
a cool progress bar that indicates the state of process while performing an scan and (aproximately) the time that lefts to complete
the task.
It supports single and range scans which can be done via TCP Connect or TCP-SYN Stealth (maybe in the future I will implement UDP).

### 📋 Notes
The main purpouse of this project is just learn, this is not the fastest or powerful scanner ever made, there's a bunch of another port 
scanners that works better (f.e.: nmap).

Feel free to fork the repo.
